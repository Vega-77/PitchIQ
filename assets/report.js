// can read, and that decision should be testable on its own — not reachable
// only through a module that opens a Firestore connection at import time.
//
// The rule it enforces: a player sees everything they did, plus the goals.
// Goals get named because they are shouted across a pitch and announced to
// everyone present; that justification does not extend to anything else. No
// teammate's minutes, no teammate's fouls, and above all no teammate's cards —
// one minor's disciplinary record is not something to publish to another minor.
//
// Labels are built here rather than on the player's page. That is the
// mechanism, not a convenience: the portal never receives the roster, so the
// only name that can reach it is one this function chose to write.

// A player's report may carry at most this many timeline entries. A tagged
// match produces a few dozen; the cap exists so a runaway log cannot push a
// document towards Firestore's 1MB limit and fail the whole publish batch —
// which would block every player's report, not just one.

// referee, a substitute warming up, somebody's dad on the touchline.
//
// It lives in `byCluster` alongside real player ids rather than in a field of
// its own because the cvMapping rules pin that document to exactly three keys
// (`firestore.rules`), and a fourth would need a rules change to store the same
// judgement. It is a real answer to the same question, not a missing one, which
// is why it is not just left blank: blank means "not looked at yet", and a
// coach who has ruled a figure out should not be asked again.
